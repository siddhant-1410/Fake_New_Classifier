## About 

Fake news classification is a streamlit app made on LSTM architecture that helps classify whether a news article is fake or not.
The model achieved an accuracy of 98% over 6 epochs.

* Word2Vec has been used to create the vector embeddings that can be fed into the model.

Headline: Scientists Discover New Planet Where Gravity Doesn't Exist
In a groundbreaking discovery, a team of scientists claims to have found a new planet located in a distant galaxy where gravity is nonexistent. According to the researchers, this bizarre world, named "NoGravity-9," defies all known laws of physics. The team, led by Dr. Jane Doe, suggests that the lack of gravity on NoGravity-9 allows objects to float indefinitely and could potentially revolutionize our understanding of space travel and physics.
"This is an unprecedented finding," said Dr. Doe during a press conference. "Our initial observations indicate that the planet’s core somehow neutralizes gravitational forces, which could have profound implications for future space missions and technology."
While this claim has sparked significant excitement among enthusiasts, many scientists remain skeptical and are calling for further verification. The scientific community is awaiting additional data to substantiate these extraordinary assertions.

New Delhi: 
On the heels of revised guidelines issued by the Government of India (MoRTH) for determining the claimed range of electric vehicles, leading EV player Tata Motors has proactively revealed the new range certification of its offerings: Curvv EV, Nexon EV, Punch EV and Tiago EV.
What Do New Guidelines Say:
The MIDC testing cycle includes two parts – urban representing city driving (P1), and extra-urban (P2) representing highway driving. Till recently, EVs were being tested only for P1 i.e. the urban part of the cycle. The Government has recently mandated all OEMs to test and declare range values with both parts of the cycle, urban and extra-urban (P1+P2), included.
Tata Motors's Take:
In addition to the MIDC range, Tata Motors is also publicly sharing the C75 range, which the company says is effectively the near real-world driving range that 75% of customers can expect. This the company says is based on the 1.65 lakh electric cars sold to date.  
Revised range:
Here's a list of revised ranges of the Tata EV offering in the market.
